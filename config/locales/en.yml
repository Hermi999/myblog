# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      text: "After working for 5 years as Software System Designer and Software Architect in the automotive industry I started to get interested in Startups. After some research (reading books, blogs & articles) and visiting startup events, I started a project called Rentog together with my co-founder and friend Peter. And I have to tell you: I really love the startup scene. It's so refreshing and exciting to have ability to really change things, learn & invent new stuff and to take full responsibility for your work and actions.<br><br>I spend much of my time in front of a screen. When I work on a project I emphasize espeically on clean code, good comments, awesome user experience and IT Security."
